# 1-Labeling Land: Land Use Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
Satellite imagery can help us find solutions to the growing number of environmental problems that we face today. It allows us to not only get a bird’s eye view of what’s around us, but also uncovers parts of the world that are rarely seen. Tapping into the potential of categorizing land cover and land use around the world means that humans can more efficiently make use of natural resources, hopefully lowering cases of waste and deprivation. But despite its potential to be incredibly useful, satellite data is massive and confusing, and making sense of it requires complex analysis.

This project could help a variety of stakeholders, including conservationists, urban planners, and environmental scientists, survey and identify patterns in land use to see which natural areas are under threat or which areas are best for urban development. But in this case, I will tailor this project to a client that is similar to the agriculture imagery company that I currently work for. Imagery companies can use land use classification models to categorize what’s in each image and optimize their efforts towards the parts of land that are important to them. For example, an agriculture company will only want to be concerned with land that’s labelled as pasture, annual crop, or permanent crop. If a satellite is constantly taking images, this project would help save hours of time manually sorting through imagery.
